# Steam Games Data Analysis

This repository contains analysis of Steam games using data obtained from the Steam Web API. The primary objective is to explore factors contributing to a game's success, with a focus on user reviews, identifying features, and uncovering patterns valuable for both players and developers.

## Project Overview

**Data Source**
The dataset was created by Martin Bustos using the Steam Web API and published on Kaggle. It is regularly updated, and the dataset used here is from the January 12, 2024 update.

**Dataset Link:** [Steam Games Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fronkongames/steam-games-dataset)

**Data Cleaning and Normalization**
The dataset underwent thorough cleaning and normalization using SQL queries, including the removal of irrelevant columns, handling NULL values, and creating separate tables for better organization.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Several SQL queries were executed for EDA, focusing on positive user review percentages, top and bottom games, trends over release years, and insights based on user reviews, concurrent users, price, platform, and more.
